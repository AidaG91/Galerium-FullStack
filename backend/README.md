## 1. Project Description  
Galerium is a backend photo gallery management system built with Java and Spring Boot. It allows clients to browse 
galleries, photographers to manage their work and clients, and admins to oversee the platform. The app follows REST API 
best practices and includes robust error handling, validation, and testing.
